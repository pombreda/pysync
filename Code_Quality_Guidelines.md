_**Code Quality Guidelines:**_
> - Meaningful variable/module names <br />
> - Comments on the code should document the "why". Refactor for "what" unless code is complex for a reason (We'll remind James to cut back on rambling comments). <br />
> - Answer questions in versioned objects <br />
> - Doctest & unit tests <br />
> - Auto generated docs <br />
> - All tests should **always** pass in the main branch of the repo (i.e. don't break the build) <br />
> - High code/test coverage <br />
> - Test normal and deliberately failing cases to ensure correctness of code.  <br />
> - Report bugs on Google Code. <br />
> - Fix bugs before writing new code (?) <br />
> - Follow PEP 8 - Python Code Style Guidelines
> > http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ <br />

> - Team member code reviews for all non-trivial fixes
> > -> We could use Google's code review tool <br />
